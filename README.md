# heuristics-for-travelling-salesman-problem
Given a set of nodes, try to find the optimal order so that the cost of a tour is minimal.
There are several files (cities25, cities50, cities75 & sixnodes) which are used
as input and from which a graph will be created. The graph for the first three files
is created using the euclidean distance whilst that is not the case for the last one.

From there, in graph.py there are several functions which try several approaches
to the problem and output the value of the tour. 

I have uploaded a document which analyses how these functions compare to each other
and the possible imporvements which could be done.
