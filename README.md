## Description of the coursework

The purpose of this project is to try several known heuristics to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem modelled as a graph. For this project, we will use a weight function between nodes which will correspond to the Euclidean distance as long as those files are under the <em>euclidean-tests</em> directory. 

On the other hand, if we are considering non-euclidean tests, the distance will be provided in the files themselves.

There are some tests provided already, but it is really easy to create your own or to get some real city from the internet and try the heuristics on it. Anyways, considering the files provided (cities25, cities50 and cities75 for the Euclidean case whilst sixnodes is for the non-Euclidean case).

Given a set of nodes, try to find the optimal order so that the cost of a tour is minimal. There are several files (cities25, cities50, cities75 & sixnodes) which are used as input and from which a graph will be created. The graph for the first three files is created using the euclidean distance whilst that is not the case for the last one.

From there, in graph.py there are several functions which try several approaches to the problem and output the value of the tour. 

I have uploaded a document which analyses how these functions compare to each other and the possible imporvements which could be done.

## Getting Started

These subsections will help you get a copy of the project and understand how to run it on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
I will discuss how to clone this repository and set it up in any IDE of your choice.

### How to Install

The first thing you should do is clone this repository into your local machine. You can do this with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Paramiru/Heuristics-TSP
```
Once you have cloned the repository, you should check your current version of Python. You can do so running this command in the terminal.
```
python --version
```
I used Python3 for the project and if you are currently using Python2 it is highly recommended you update to Python3.

Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the Python files (.py) in your favourite text editor. I used VS Code, but you can use Vim, Emacs or whatever you feel most comfortable with.

## Running the Project 

Having downloaded the project, you can try the heuristics coded in <em>graph.py</em> from <em>tests.py</em>. In order to use your own tests, just put the path to you file in the end of <em>tests.py</em> and run the file from your editor or from the terminal (with the current directory of your terminal session being Heuristics-TSP/python-files)
```bash
python3 tests.py
```
